# Traffic-Signal-Optimization-using-Genetic-Algorithm

## Problem Statement

The increasing urban traffic has led to rising congestion, extended travel times, and heightened hazards to pedestrians due to inefficient traffic light controls. Conventional traffic light controllers operate on fixed cycle times, disregarding the dynamic nature of traffic loads. This rigid approach often leads to suboptimal traffic flow, longer waiting times at red lights, and an overall decrease in transportation efficiency. The need for an intelligent and adaptive traffic control system is evident to address these challenges and optimize the flow of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic at intersections.

## Proposed Solution

Implement a genetic algorithm approach to dynamically optimize traffic light timings based on real-time traffic load inputs. The genetic algorithm should adaptively adjust the duration of red and green lights to maximize the flow of vehicles and pedestrians through the intersection.

We apply such technology to a four-way, two-lane junction. The algorithms dynamically optimize the red and green times to control the flow of the vehicles.

## How It Works

The system utilizes a genetic algorithm to iteratively adjust traffic light timings based on the current traffic conditions. The algorithm considers real-time traffic load inputs and adapts the duration of red and green lights to optimize the overall flow of vehicles and pedestrians through the intersection.

## Usage
